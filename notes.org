* Qtile Notes
** Lazy Functions
*** Arguments
- Lazy functions or functions that call lazy functions are given the qtile argument. This this is why the
  error takes x positional arguments but x+1 were given can happen.
** Screen Affinity
I don't totally understand it yet but i gave the group scrn2 screen affinity for screen1. When I use scrn2's keybinding it will always open on screen1 and not screen0.
** Mouse
*** qtile.warp_to_screen()
- warps the mouse to the center of the current screen

* Inbox
** [2023-10-21 Sat 00:04] Working on colors
- i want to make a section where all the colors are stored so it is easy to change color pallets without having to dig through all of the different individual classes and their arguments
