** TODO [2023-10-22 Sun] Trying to Open App on Startup
- I want to open thunderbird in group 5 (extra) on startup
- i was going to use open_in_group, however it is a lazy function
- i made the function not lazy but then i ran into issues
  + this was even after removing qtile from the arguments
[[file:~/.config/qtile/README.org::*open_in_group()][open_in_group()]]
** [2023-10-21 Sat 00:04] Working on colors, i want to make a section where all the colors are stored so it is easy to change color pallets without having to dig through all of the different individual classes and their arguments
[[file:~/.config/qtile/README.org::*COLORS][COLORS]]
